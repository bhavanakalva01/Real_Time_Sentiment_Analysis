# Real_Time_Sentiment_Analysis
This project collects live social media data (e.g., tweets) using APIs and analyzes public emotions in real time. Using Pythonâ€™s NLP libraries (TextBlob, VADER, or Transformers), it classifies posts into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments. The results are displayed through real-time graphs and dashboards using Matplotlib/Streamlit.
